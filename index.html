        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains what information Quickeys collects and
          how it's used. Quickeys is a Chrome extension designed to create and
          manage custom keyboard shortcuts for your browser.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Quickeys collects the following information as you use the extension:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Website content:</span> We access webpage
            elements and content to interact with them when shortcuts are
            triggered. This allows the extension to click buttons, fill forms,
            or manipulate page elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Web browsing history:</span> We access your
            current URL and browsing history to enable site-specific shortcuts
            that only activate on specific websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">User activity:</span> We capture keyboard
            combinations to detect when shortcuts should be activated. The
            extension monitors keyboard events to recognize when you've
            triggered a custom shortcut.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Settings and preferences:</span> We store
            your custom shortcuts, site patterns, and extension configurations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information Collected Automatically</h2>
        <p>The extension automatically collects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Current URL and domain information of pages you visit</li>
          <li>Keyboard combinations you press</li>
          <li>
            Page elements and structure when shortcuts interact with webpage
            content
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          All data is processed locally within your browser and used solely to
          provide the core functionality of the extension:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Detecting keyboard shortcuts:</span> To
            recognize when you've pressed a keyboard combination to trigger a
            shortcut
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Executing commands on websites:</span> To
            perform actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, or controlling
            media
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Applying site-specific shortcuts:</span> To
            enable shortcuts that only work on specific websites
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Maintaining your preferences:</span> To save
            your custom shortcuts and extension settings
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Data is Handled</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Local Processing:</span> All data is
            processed entirely on your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">No External Servers:</span> Your data never
            leaves your browser or gets sent to external servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Chrome Storage API:</span> Your shortcuts and
            settings are stored using Chrome's built-in storage API, which keeps
            the data on your device.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Quickeys stores your configuration data (custom shortcuts, settings)
          using Chrome's storage API. This data remains on your device and is
          not transmitted to external servers. Your data is retained until:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You manually remove shortcuts or reset the extension</li>
          <li>You uninstall the extension</li>
          <li>You clear your browser data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          No data is retained on our servers as all processing occurs locally on
          your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="emphasis"
            >Quickeys does not share any user data with third parties or
            external services.</span
          >
          Since all data is processed locally on your device and never
          transmitted to any servers, there is no sharing of your information
          with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our company (as no data is collected by us)</li>
          <li>Third-party companies or individuals</li>
          <li>Advertising or analytics providers</li>
          <li>Any other external parties</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The only exception would be if required by law, in which case we would
          comply with legal obligations.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Security</h2>
        <p>
          The extension's design inherently protects your privacy since all data
          remains local to your device. This approach eliminates many security
          concerns related to data transmission and external storage.
        </p>

        <h2>User Rights and Control</h2>
        <p>You can view and manage all stored data by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Viewing your shortcuts in the extension's options page</li>
          <li>Editing or deleting individual shortcuts</li>
          <li>Clearing all data by resetting the extension</li>
          <li>Uninstalling the extension to remove all associated data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
          you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        </p>
